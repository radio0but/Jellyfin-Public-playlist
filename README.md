# Jellyfin-Public-playlist
ONLY WORKS ON Linux 


A script to convert a user made playlist to a m3u file that can be shared publicly

Once you created a playlist in jellyfin go to /var/lib/jellyfin/data/playlists/ copy the folder 
with your playlist in your music media folder. 
Then delete the iibrary in jellyfin interface 
put the xmlToM3u.sh script inside the folder you copied in your media folder
make it executable 
give the scipt file a doubleclic 
and you should see a m3u playlist with the name of the parent folder apear ! 
Then its just a mather of refreshing your library in jellyfin.
